                "content": "Congratulations on your well-deserved entry to the GIK Institute, where the aim is to pursue the  highest standards in education and research. The educational philosophy of the Institute emphasizes  the training of mind rather than stuffing it with an inert body of facts and on expanding the scientific  imagination rather than making them tread the well-worn and outmoded grooves of thought. Guided  by such convictions, students are educated by confronting them with real-life problems and  inculcating in them a problem-solving approach. You are encouraged to explore, to solve problems,  to break new grounds and to develop leadership qualities.  This Handbook is a very important document. Students are advised to read it very carefully and keep  it with them for the entire duration of their study in this Institute. The rules and regulations are subject  to change any time and in that case, students will be notified accordingly.  This Handbook addresses expectations concerning student conduct and performance and provides  information on the various student support systems available on the campus. A careful study of this  will help you in settling down and will provide you with the essential guidelines needed to  successfully pursue your studies at this Institute.  It is understood that your sole purpose of coming here is to acquire knowledge. You will find that  faculty and staff of the Institute are fully committed to helping you achieve your cherished goal.  Excellence in academics and upholding of the valued traditions of its heritage and culture are the  hallmarks of the policy followed by the Institute. Some important information, which is of direct  concern to the students, has been collected in this Handbook."

You are expected to meet the hostel warden who will help you in  solving all your hostel-related problems. You are not permitted to change or swap the allotted room  on your own. Please check the room thoroughly and record deficiency/discrepancy or breakage, if  any. You will find the rules about the hostel and the mess later in this handbook.   Tuition Fee:   GIK Institute collects a fee on a semester basis. 5% of semester tuition fee will be collected as  administrative charges against each semester. No administrative charges will be charged if students  pay the entire fee for two semesters in a lump sum. Tuition fee may be payable before the  commencement of academic session, failing which students are NOT allowed to register for the  courses. As per Institute policy, students can apply for Financial Assistance under “Changed  Circumstances” policy. However, grant of Financial Assistance would be subject to the availability  of budget. Fine of Rs. 50 per day will be charged on delayed payment.   Discipline:   The co-education system practiced at the Institute, places a heavy responsibility on the Institute  management and the students alike. The students are, therefore, expected to follow a code of conduct  that is in line with our culture, tradition, and values, particularly concerning ethics and moral  behaviour. Very serious view is taken of misconduct and immoral behaviour both inside and  outside the classrooms."

For serious matters, there is a STUDENT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE  consisting of senior faculty members which deals with all cases of indiscipline brought to its notice.  Counselling: The Dean Student Affairs and staff of Student Affairs Department are readily available  for sorting out your problems whether personal, social, or academic. In times of need, which may be  rather frequent, you must seek his advice. A student wellness counselor is also available for the  students in the Department of Student Affairs.

Please guide me with it urgently.",

Also, there is no harm in asking your parents for money if you are very low on cash. You have to remind yourself that you are living in Pakistan, not in America or some western country where high school and college students working part-time jobs is considered normal. Also people here are not very open to that idea.\n\nBuilding skill is not easy and requires practice and discipline. I would personally suggest that you try being part of workshops and bootcamps. I am talking about the ones that are organized by universities and established companies. They will not only give you the skills, but you may also end up getting a part-time/full-time position through their referrals."

It should also be something that you feel you can be good at, because you know yourself best.\n\nIt could be something as simple as social media handling, or designing a poster or making an app. To learn it, you will have to do it 1-2 times properly without any incentive in return just for your practice. Get a friend to review it (university helps here, cos there's so many people around you, you can learn from them), and then learn more so you can refine it, improve it.\n\nOk, now you have a portfolio. Time to find a client.\n\nAgain, university is helpful here. You'll find students around you giving out freelance projects, or someone they know who is willing to pay. You just need to find that first client, impress him, and then purely by word of mouth, you can get more clients. It's not easy to find the first person, but it's not impossible.\n\nI think key thing here is to stick with that thing you started with, long enough. Most people won't do that.\n\nAlso another key thing is to take me with a grain of salt as I am also not earning lol. But I hope this helped."

And then reach fast Lahore at 7:40 am-8:am. 3 out of 4 days my classes start at 10 am and end everyday at 5:20 pm. I leave the university at 5:30 pm and reach back home at 8:00 pm.   First 2 weeks I was living in the hostel. And I didn't find myself studying and I didn't have any peace of mind. When I was leaving home for the hostel my mother hugged me and cried a lot. My father is living abroad.   When it comes to my progress it's been 2 months since I've maintained the GitHub streak and 1 month of leetcode streak. And working on the Web application (react and Firebase). Got a mid1 result and have some healthy marks despite 1( 1cr hr).   Kindly advise me on what should I do. Should I join the hostel? ",

(One family member does it and stay overnight in his uni when the class is super early the next day or super late at night).\nU can also check affordable and safe private hostels, specially easy if ur a boy. \n\nI fucked up my studies because my mom was alone and I wanted to spend more time with her than study. We used to live alone back then. Don\u2019t do that mistake. Do spend time with her but only after you have done your work. Make sure she stays busy in reading and walks and gardening and housework, put on some dramas u think she\u2019ll get hooked on. She cried because ofcourse it\u2019s hard but don\u2019t take it too hard and fuck up your process long term. \n\n\n\n\n\nI would say for now make a burn out safe 5 am schedule. And follow it for a month or two before making a final decision. \nSo u go there for four days at 5 am to 8pm but u take helpful supplies with u. Sleep early beforehand. On it free days excercise and don\u2019t try to \u201crelax\u201d by gaming or using it phone for hours. Study in the free days  but also meet a friend of ur an extrovert and it calms u."

At first, my roommate seemed like a decent guy\u2014smart and someone who mostly kept to himself. But lately, things have become very weird. I have no idea how long it\u2019s been since he last showered; the room constantly reeks of a piss smell (no joke), and I have to use air freshener every hour just to cope with it.  The first time I caught him was last Tuesday, right after my CH class. I walked in and found him in the middle of \"the act\", with tissues and Vaseline on his bed. I left immediately and went to GIKafe, hoping he'd get it together before I came back. But when I returned half an hour later, he was acting like nothing happened\u2014no embarrassment at all. I even brought back some rolls, and he casually joined me like everything was normal. I don\u2019t mind sharing food, but the situation made me extremely uncomfortable. Honestly, I think he does it at night too, because I\u2019ve heard those gross sloshy noises more than a few times.  Then, last night, I caught him again after I got back from Tuc, and this time, he had the audio on while watching. I don\u2019t know what kind of kink he\u2019s into, because clearly anyone standing just outside the door could hear the audio. At this point, I just want to change my roommate, but I\u2019m not sure who to report this to. I can\u2019t deal with this for the rest of the year.  P.S.: If you\u2019re reading this, please learn some basic etiquette and get help!!  Edit: I tried talking to him after my morning class and he literally said \" lrke krte hn ye sb, tumne kabhi muth nhi maari? room change krana h tou kralo\". I am definitely going to report to Sabahat. ",

During his address, Mr. Jamil Akhtar—a WAPDA member and Chief Guest—emphasized the need for creative solutions to address national challenges and the crucial role Universities like GIKI play in resolving various issues. \"WAPDA has been playing a key role in the development of Pakistan since its inception and right moves for a greater role to fulfill the country's electricity requirements,\" he said. He also announced the establishment of WAPDA University, like GIK Institute. Former Chairman WAPDA, Mr. Shakil Durrani, Executive Director of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Pakistan (SOPREST), also attended the event. \nProf. Dr. Fazal Ahmad Khalid, Rector of GIK Institute, said that the GIKI faculty has focused on research activities and inspired the students, which was the main reason that leading multinational companies worldwide had hired their produced students. \"Graduates of GIK Institute are in great demand among companies around the world, and we are proud to produce students of such caliber who can play a huge contributing role in the country's economy,\" he remarked, adding that in December, the Institute has planned to celebrate three decades of excellence.\nOver 100 Companies participated in the GIKI Industrial Open House 2024. At the 2-Days event, 135 final-year projects were displayed, providing a platform for students to showcase their talent to 100+ companies. Industry leaders interacted with students, fostering knowledge exchange and potential employment prospects. During the event, companies interacted with students, shortlisted candidates, and conducted interviews for recruitment purposes. \nIn recognition of excellence, certificates were awarded to the top projects from each department, honoring the students' hard work and dedication.",

The Character Building Society (CBS) hosted the event under the supervision of the Dean Student Affairs Office. The event featured impactful speeches by representatives of the Literary and Debating Society (LDS) and GIKI College students, a poignant tableau demonstration, and a symbolic Solidarity Walk from the sports ground to the clock tower, led by the Rector, Prof. Dr. Fazal A. Khalid, SI, and Pro-Rector (A&F), Sardar Aminullah Khan.\n\nThe participants at the event included the Rector, Pro-Rector, faculty, staff, and students, who all came together to raise awareness and show support for the oppressed people of IIOJK. The event concluded with a one-minute silence, symbolizing GIKI's heartfelt empathy for the struggles the people of (IIOJ) Kashmir face in their efforts for their right to self-determination.\n\n#KashmirSolidarityDay #KashmirDay",

Khalid, Rector, GIK Institute, has met with a group of final year project titled Dublr, which has recently attracted a lot of attention from industry, academia and alumni. \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/CsVeDjVIlc5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MmJiY2I4NDBkZg==\n\nThe advisor of the project, Prof. Dr. Ghulam Abbas, was also present. Dublr is an AI-based end-to-end automated dubbing system that utilizes voice cloning and lip syncing technology to generate realistic outputs. It takes as input a video clip in any language and generates an output video clip dubbed in English. The rector showed genuine interest in the project, appreciated the work, and discussed its potential to revolutionize the dubbing industry. The future prospects of the project including the incubation of the project at the GIK’s Incubation Center were also discussed. The rector presented the team a shield as a token of recognition and appreciation for the efforts put forth by the team.",

They can become senior managers later on. Due to this, companies are perpetually on the lookout for people with solid communication skills. The implication for students is that they must also strive to develop solid presentation and communication skills besides studying hard.\n\nOne of the major problems facing today’s Pakistani students is the lack of interaction between Pakistan’s academic and professional communities. As a result, young undergraduates lack sufficient knowledge of the professional world, and companies remain unaware of the great potential of these future workers.\n\nSOPHEP was formed to help close this information gap and create a bridge between these two vital communities. In this regard, SOPHEP holds workshops by successful GIK alums that help students refine their people skills and become job-smart. The society also offers students projects from the industrial community, which gives budding engineers and managers a chance to gain valuable real-world experience – something that looks great on any C.V.\n\n#GIKI #GIKISocieties #OurSocieties #SOPHEP",

The LDS alumni have spread far and wide to reach the pinnacle of academic and industrial achievement. They have produced debaters par excellence, legendary speakers whose wit has become immortalized on national television in debating halls across the country and, in some bright sparks, across the global debating community.\nWhat is it about LDS that brings out the best in people? The answer to that question is easy. LDS society believes in the power of reason. They argue, lacerate, and yet communicate. They accept diversity, encourage opinions, cherish inflaming conversations, and love off-kilter references. Yet, for all that, their members emerge as competent, well-rounded human beings, perfectly capable of communicating our unique selves to the world and inordinately eager to accept the strange, the new, and the wonderful into themselves. \nSo if you have an interesting story or a good joke, or if you love Joyce, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, or Kafka, or if you really dig Tool's lyrics, or the poetry in Bob Dylan's verse, or if Godard or Christopher Nolan reached into your soul, and most importantly, if you like talking (or would like to learn to speak) about all of these things, come see our LDS...\n\nMention LDS alumni in the comments section and share some memories. \n\n#GIKI #GIKISocieties #OurSocieties",

Engineering also plays an important role in global human development, sustainability, and preservation of the environment. The importance of high-quality engineering education is therefore self-evident. Based on the speaker’s experience as a professional engineer and university educator, this paper highlights the recent challenges, opportunities, and future trends in engineering education. Major challenges currently facing engineering education are related to curriculum, teaching and learning, and the educational environment. As to quality, the balance needs to be maintained between general excellence and targeted areas of excellence. In terms of pedagogy, the focus should be on the improvement of students’ problem-solving and learning skills, the ability for continued learning throughout their careers, and soft skills (leadership qualities, teamwork, communication skills, and an understanding of economics, business, management, and innovation and entrepreneurship). Good support should be available in terms of qualified technical personnel and well-equipped workshops, laboratories, and computing facilities. Some of the emerging trends in engineering education include hands-on learning labs, industry-centric curriculum, upgradation of classroom environment and facilities (to support active learning and group-based learning), and use of interactive learning technologies (such as adaptive learning software, e-learning, distance learning, etc.).",

The competition required us to come up with a solution for different problem statements given. \nOur problem statement was Walkability: How women face issues when walking on the footpaths, waiting for busses, and just going about their normal life while being in a public space. To cater to the issues, we proposed a device that could alert the authorities and people nearby in case of any inappropriate doings. The device was a microprocessor chip that could be attached to anything that a woman was wearing, a watch, necklace, bracelet, or even tie up as a band under her sleeve. The chip would be activated through speech recognition. Open buying the chip, the person who was going to use it could customize it and feed a safe word that would later activate the chip. When the chip is activated, it will send the location coordinates to the nearest Police Station while also ringing an alarm and a very high-intensity light. This will be done to startle the intruder. \nOur proposed solution was able to secure the second position in the competition with a monetary prize of 30,000Rs. The following members participated in the competition: \n1. Erum Iftikhar (Batch 29) \n2. Imtesal Ameena (Batch 30) \n3. Afiya Rehman (Batch 31) \n4. Rafay Mustafa (Batch 31)",

Red Bull Paper Wings is a paper plane flying competition primarily for students. It is also the official Paper Plane World Championship. There are 3 disciplines in this championship:\n1. Longest Distance\n2. Longest Airtime\n3. Aerobatics\nFor this purpose, we conduct qualifier rounds on selective University campuses to give the students a chance to showcase their creativity & design thinking through paper plane flying and win a chance to represent Pakistan on a global platform. One student for each discipline from each campus gets qualified to take part in the city qualifier, where they compete against students from other universities. Further, one student from each discipline qualifies for the Pakistan National Finals which will be taking place on 19th March 2022. Finally, the national winners go to Hangar-7 in Salzburg, Austria to represent Pakistan at the World Finals against winners from 60 other countries.\nFor registration:\nScan the QR code or click on the link given below:\nhttps://paperwings.redbull.com/pk-en/event/486\nYou can also contact our campus representative \nMuhammad Saad Raja\n+923007645738\n@redbullpakistan\nEvent Organizer: AIAA GIK @aiaagiki",
